A block will be shown by a template file. When a block returns to HTML code by calling toHtml() function,
it will get a template file and then flush variables to this file.
One block can flush its variables many template files. Similarly, itâ€™s possible for a template to show lots of block types.
A template is maybe unnecessary for one block but one template compulsorily requires a block attached to it in Magento.
In a template file, we are able to use $this pointer to call functions as well as take the values of the block attached to this template.
